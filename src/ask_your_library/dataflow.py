"""The settings that decide where data goes, and the rule for "fully local".

One definition for the Python side: `ayl init` judges its local mode with it,
and the verification step of `scripts/install-mac.sh` imports it. The
installer's own guard runs before any Python is installed and keeps a bash
copy of the same names (`BACKEND_VARS` ... `KEY_VARS` there); a name added
here is a name to add there.

Tracing is read by two libraries with two truth tables. langsmith reads the
four v2 names for "is tracing on" and uploads on the exact string "true" —
every value outside TRACING_OFF is treated as on here, the fail-closed side.
langchain_core reads the two v1 names and counts a name as SET unless its
value is "", "0", "false" or "False"; set, with v2 tracing off, it makes the
first model call raise. LANGCHAIN_TRACING is in both lists on purpose.
